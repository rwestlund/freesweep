	This will eventually be a readme file. For now, just a list of notes.

	Freesweep is licensed under the GNU GPL, version 2 or above. See
the file COPYING, run freesweep with the -g flag, or hit 'g' while playing
the game to see it. The code is copyright Gus Hartmann and Peter Keller.

	We need to have some sort of standard header in all the files
the mentions the copyright and GNU GPL.

	Bugs should be mailed to sweep@cs.wisc.edu, if it works, or
hartmann@cs.wisc.edu otherwise.

	Color works, but right now the values are not customizable. Sorry.

	If no file locking mechanism is found, group-writable best times
will be disabled.

	While the game is playable on any terminal supported by curses/ncurses,
the help and high scores windows are designed to use a screen 80 columns wide.

	On most X keymaps, both the left arrow and the down arrow don't
work, reporting "Unknown keystroke." Unfortunately, somehow this leaves an
extra 'o' lying around, leading to a saved game getting loaded. Really
fucking bizarre- Sun's curses doesn't have the arrows-under-X problem.

Fix up the error condition for what happens when you can't write to the
best times file and shit. Just quitting doesn't seem to good.
Also, fix the creation permissions of the group file. Like either the client
can make a new one with 666 perms, or the installer makes one with the
correct permissions.

See if purify bitches about what I wrote with the reconfig shit.

See what purify is bitching about in the load/save game code.

Sun's curses doesn't do standout() correctly on a Linux term.

Special thanks to Pete Keller for lots of help.
Thanks to the FSF for the license and certain chunks of code.
Thanks to the Undergraduate Project Lab at the University of Wisconsin
