	This will eventually be a readme file. For now, just a list of notes.

	The -s command line option will save any settings passed on the
command line. This will occur even if the user selects against saving
settings in the interactive setup. Use of -s without -f is discouraged.

	Old preference file formats are supported by converting them to the
new format and deleting the previous version.

	The Makefile assumes multiple architecture builds, and identifies the
system with a string given off by the GNU config.guess script.

	While the game is playable on any terminal supported by ncurses,
the help and high scores windows are designed to use a screen 80 columns wide.

	The use of the -d option overrides all other options.

	On most X keymaps, both the left arrow and the down arrow don't
work, reporting "Unknown keystroke." Unfortunately, somehow this leaves an
extra 'o' lying around, leading to a saved game getting loaded.

	There should be a stats window, under the info win, on the right
side of the screen, with the elapsed game time, the number of mines marked,
and the total number of mines.

	New key that should work: 'n' for "New Game" - abort the current
game and start a new one, counting the game as neither a win nor a loss.

	New key: 'r' for "Reconfigure" - abort the current game (as above),
but instead of restarting with the same game, run AskPrefs() to determine
what the user wants for the new games.

	Time in seconds should work. Basically, I'm thinking a volatile int
that gets incremented by a signal handler. At the end of the main loop, check
to see if the int has gotten set, and then increment Game->Time.

See what purify is bitching about in the load/save game code.
