/* acconfig.h
   This file is in the public domain.

   Descriptive text for the C preprocessor macros that
   the distributed Autoconf macros can define.
   No software package will use all of them; autoheader copies the ones
   your configure.in uses into your configuration header file templates.

   The entries are in sort -df order: alphabetical, case insensitive,
   ignoring punctuation (such as underscores).  Although this order
   can split up related entries, it makes it easier to check whether
   a given entry is in the file.

   Leave the following blank line there!!  Autoheader needs it.  */


/* Comment this out to have a debug log file. */
#undef DEBUG_LOG

/* Set this blah blah blah. */
#undef SCORESDIR

/* Comment this out to use a shared best times file. */

/* Leave that blank line there!!  Autoheader needs it.
   If you're adding to this file, keep in mind:
